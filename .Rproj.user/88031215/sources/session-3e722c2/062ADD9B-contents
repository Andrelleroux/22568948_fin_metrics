    This article will discuss the process through which a portfolio was 
    constructed from a mix of traded global indexes that takes into account
    several constraints in it's construction.

# Data {-}

The Data used in this article consists of a number of global traded indexes which include indexes of currencies, bonds, credit, equities and commodities. The data included each indexes daily price.

# Analysis  {-}

The first table is the optimal weightings of assets as of the most recent date in the data, looking at the past 3 years of data. These weight have been optimised to conform to the following constraints. Individual asset weighting can not exceed 40% or be less than 0%, bonds and credit indexes can not make up more than 25% and Equities can not make up more than a combined 60%.

```{r, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

Combined_df <- Data_Read_Wrangle()
Combined_df

```

##### Table 1: {-}

```{r, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot_Table <- Current_Opt(Combined_df)
plot_Table
```

We can see in _table 1_ that the latest optimal portfolio consists of 25% US Credit; 15% Commodities; 20% of the All Country World Index and 40% in the US equity market. This portfolio was solved using mean-variance optimisation. 

In order to check how liable these weights are to change I ran a rebalancing time frame across the available historical data, measuring three years into the past at each point and optimising the weights. _Figure 1_ displays my results.

##### Figure 1: {-}

```{r, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot_HistOpt <- Port_Rebalancing(Combined_df)
plot_HistOpt
```

When looking at historical rebalancing it appears that the current optimal weights have remained optimal for the past seven years.

# Conclusion {-}

When designing an optimal portfolio for traded global indexes we find a very stable equilibrium weighting vector that provides the optimal mean-variance tradeoff
