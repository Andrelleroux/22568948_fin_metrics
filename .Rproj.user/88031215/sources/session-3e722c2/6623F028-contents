    This report will analyse the individual and comparative volatility of the
    South African Rand within the context of other global countries. Thus, 
    getting a more well rounded understanding of the volatility of the Rand.

# Data {-}

The Data used in this report consists of daily level exchange rate data, daily data for the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index (BBDXY), which is the value of the US Dollar in comparison to other G10 country currencies and the Deutsche Bank G10 Harvest Index as a proxy for the returns of a carry strategy of G10 currencies.

# Analysis  {-}

The first graph is a simple ranking of the annualised standard deviation over the past 5 years for all currencies in our dataset. This gives us a rough first estimate of the relative volatility of the Rand in comparison to other currencies.

```{r, results='hide'}

Currencies_df <- Data_Workings()
Currencies_df

```

##### Figure 1: {-}

```{r, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 9}
plot_Hist <- Plot_sdRank(Currencies_df)
plot_Hist
```

South Africa (in green) is ranked 6th over the last 6 years in standard deviation of currency. On the other end of the graph we see extremely low standard deviation from currencies that are fixed or pegged to the US Dollar. _Figure 1_ provides some evidence that the South African Rand is one of the most volatile currencies in the last couple of years.

In order to get a more accurate prediction of variance I look at the rate of change persistence of the South African Rand to look for any signs of first order and second order persistence.

##### Figure 2: {-}

```{r}
plot_Persist <- Return_Persistence(Currencies_df)
plot_Persist
```

It appears clear from _figure 2_ that there is first and second order persistence, however I also conducted a Ljung-Box test which returned a p-value of 0. Thereby strongly suggesting the use of a GARCH model.

The next step I do is to implement the GARCH and graph the difference in sigma's with and without the GARCH model to demonstrate it's effects.

##### Figure 3: {-}

```{r}
Garch_plot <- Fitting_Garch(Currencies_df)
Garch_plot
```
As a result of the GARCH(1,1) model we can see a vast decrease in variance as the noise is removed from the process. 

I also then fit a GO-GARCH model with the following variables: South African Rand, the BBDXY,  the Deutsche Bank G10 Harvest Index, EU and China for exposure to several other possibly correlated series. The figure is the approximation for the time variant correlation between these currencies. The highlighted time period are period where the rolling mean of the bbdxy was above it's total sample mean (periods where the Dollar is strong).

##### Figure 4 {-}

```{r}
GoGarch_plot <- Imp_Go_Garch(Currencies_df)
GoGarch_plot
```
From _figure 4_ we can see that the Rand is negatively correlated with a G10 carry trade. Reinforcing the idea that the Rand does well when currency valuations are relatively cheap. However, the Rand positively correlated with the EU, China and the US. Although uncertain there appears to be some evidence that the correlation between the US Dollar and the Rand goes down during periods when the Dollar is strong. Suggesting a risk-on sentiment. 

# Conclusion {-}

We have found evidence in the data that supports the idea that the Rand is one of the more volatile currencies over the last year and does well when currencies are valued relatively cheap.
